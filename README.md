# Easy Markov Chain Text Generation
***An implementation of the Markov Chain in python tuned for text generation with a simple CLI.***


## Getting Started

Download the executable and place it in an empty folder. Double-click the program to start it. 


## Using the CLI

The program needs the source text file to be in the same directory as the executable for the file to be found. *This will be fixed in a later version.* The entered filename __must__ be the filename only, not the path to the file. For example, `example_filename.txt` is valid, but `C:\Users\Username\example_filename.txt`will result in an error and crash the program. *This will also be fixed in a later version.*
